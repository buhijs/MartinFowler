How are we going to maintain data integrity in a multi-user concurrent system?

How are we going to overcome the limitations of Optimistic offline locking?

1. It is a compliment to OOL

2. Use when conflict possibilities is high between object.

3. Choose between long transaction and Pessimistic offline lock.

Solution 2: PessimisticOfflineLock

Three steps to implement this.
