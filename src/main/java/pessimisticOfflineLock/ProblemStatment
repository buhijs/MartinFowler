How are we going to maintain data integrity in a multi-user concurrent system?

How are we going to overcome the limitations of Optimistic offline locking?

1. It is a compliment to OOL

2. Use when conflict possibilities is high between object.

3. Choose between long transaction and Pessimistic offline lock.

Solution 2: PessimisticOfflineLock

Three steps to implement this.

1. Determine what type of locks we need.
2. Create a LockManager.
3. Define procedures for business transactions to use locks.


POL requires at minimum choreographing an
1. application session
2. business transaction
3. lock manager
4. system transaction
5. which clearly is a challenge.
